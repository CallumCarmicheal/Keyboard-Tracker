# Keyboard-Tracker
Tracks how many times a key is pressed during a time period

# Why
I got the idea while using a Application called IOGraph by IOGraphica, it does not make nice graphs but instead it
gives a list of the keys you pressed since the application was started/unpaused. 

At the moment all it does is count and show the keys with numbers 

# Privacy
This application does nothing with the data that it gathers (YET, SOON IT WILL BE USED TO HACK THE WORLD. no not really), 
Later i may connect it to a website to count the total amount of times everyone has pressed a key (I sounds like a interesting project).

# What can i do with this
What ever you want

# What can i do with the source
What ever you want, Sell it but make sure you credit me somewhere even if its a little text print at 6pt.
